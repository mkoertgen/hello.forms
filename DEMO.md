### 3. Right Panel: Properties & Preview

- **Left Panel**: SQL Schema browser with sample tables (users, orders, products)
- **Center**: Form designer canvas with drag-and-drop area
- **Right Panel**: Field palette and properties editor
- **Top Toolbar**: Form actions (add step, preview, export/import)

### 3. Create Your First Form

**Step 1: Start with SQL Schema**

1. Expand the "users" table in the left panel

3. Select the field and edit properties in the "Properties" tab

**Step 3: Configure Validation**

2. In the Properties panel, toggle "Required"
3. Add placeholder text and help text

### 4. Create a Multi-Step Wizard

**Step 1: Add Steps**

1. Click "Add Step" in the toolbar
2. Give your step a title like "Personal Information"
3. Add another step called "Contact Details"

**Step 2: Organize Fields**

2. Each step tab shows assigned fields
3. Fields can be moved between steps

### 5. Preview Your Form

**Live Preview:**

3. Test validation by trying to submit without required fields
4. Navigate through multi-step forms

### 6. Export/Import

**Export Schema:**

2. The schema follows OpenAPI-style structure
3. Includes all fields, validation rules, and step configuration

## API Integration

The application provides REST APIs for:
